This repo is my personal journal and code dump as I learn Unreal Engine from scratch.

 Why I'm Learning Unreal
I want to master Unreal Engine to build high-performance games and interactive experiences at a professional level. Unreal Engine is powerful for AAA games and I want to master both Blueprints and C++.
